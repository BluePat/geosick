# Geosick

Geosick is a library written for the Covid19cz and ZostanZdravy initiatives by Jan Plhák
(jan.plhak@kiwi.com) and Jan Špaček (patek.mail@gmail.com). The purpose of the library is to provide
a functionality for GPS sequencies analysis to determine the probability of a healthy person
getting infected by someone sick (e.g. infected by the Covid19 virus). We provide two main
services.

## Batch processing

For processing of a large number of users and their GPS sequences, we provide a C++ tool that is
capable of evaluating hundreds of thousands of user GPS sequences, comparing them with GPS
sequences of sick people and reporting all possibly infected users. For more details, please
refer to our [batch processing docs](docs/batch_processing.md). If you would like to use it,
please reach out to us using the contacts listed above and we will assist you with the integration
of our tool into your setup.
