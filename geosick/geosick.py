## API

# Sample of a user location. The samples for a user must be ordered by timestamp
# (increasing).
#
# We assume that the samples are taken with a steady rate, so we can reasonably
# interpolate between samples. To indicate that there is a gap in the data (i.e., the GPS
# signal was lost or the collection was stopped), mark the last sample before the gap with
# `is_end = True`: we will assume that there is no knowledge of the user position between
# the sample with `is_gap = True` and the following sample.
#
# We also assume that we don't know anything about the position before the first sample
# and after the last sample.
#
# The horizontal and vertical accuracy are assumed to be maximum "reasonable" distance of
# the true position from the indicated position: it is NOT a standard deviation.
